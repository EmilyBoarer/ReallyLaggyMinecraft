# ReallyLaggyMinecraft
I thought I could make a Minecraft clone, but the low frame rate just got in the way

you must supply your own artwork, the included artwork is all white

run main.py

if you have a controller plugged in: use left joystick to move, right to look, and the two bumpers to de/ascend

else: use w,a,s, and d to move, the mouse to look, and space/shift to de/ascend


this was really difficult to make so please forgive the imperfect code
