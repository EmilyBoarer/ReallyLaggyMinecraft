# ReallyLaggyMinecraft
I thought I could make a Minecraft clone, but the low frame rate just got in the way

run main.py

if you have a controller plugged in: use left joystick to move, right to look, and the two bumpers to de/ascend

else: use w,a,s, and d to move, the mouse to look, and space/shift to de/ascend


this was really difficult to make so please forgive the imperfact code

(I have a new, much better, project that is currently in the planning stage, which will hopefully be a whole lot better, if more like my Langame mixed with Nuclear Throne than ReallyLaggyMinecraft - this project will actually have some decent code in it and should function a lot better!)
